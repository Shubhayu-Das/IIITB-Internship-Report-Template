Please note that there are a bunch of configuration variables from line 60 of the TEX file:

Please make sure to populate these with the correct values. Alternatively, you can see where they are used and replace
them with the necessary values.

I will *not* be help everyone using this script with individual problems. Please raise issues in this repo, so that any
past problems are documented. If there are any major problems anywhere, I _might_ make the effort to correct it (Feel
